/* This file contains definitions related to the Tungsten object system. In LLVM, a Tungsten
 * object is represented by a block of memory containing a vtable pointer, a number of fields
 * (stored in the same order as declared in the class, aligned appropriately), and a number of
 * pointers used to represent reified type arguments. Each word in the type argument list
 * is either a pointer to a class_info, an interface_info, or null (for the nothing type). 
 * If the type argument has more type arguments, they are stored immediately afterward. For
 * example, if an object has the class A[B[C, D], E[F, G]], the type argument words would be
 * B, C, D, E, F, G.
